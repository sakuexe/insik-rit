## Wihi

The thesis process progresses with the Wihi system in Pakki. You start your thesis
in Wihi by creating a topic proposal. After you have been assigned a supervisor,
you can use Wihi to plan your schedule for completing the thesis. You use Wihi
to send messages to the thesis supervisor and the commissioner, so the different
stages of the process are stored in one place. The work will also be published
and evaluated in Wihi. Read the 
[Wihi instructions for students](https://www.hamk.fi/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/student-Wihi-instructions.pdf) 
for more information. 

## Open Badge of a thesis expert

An Open Badge of a thesis expert is completed at the beginning of the thesis
process at the latest, and a screen capture of the badge is sent to the 
supervisor via a Wihi message. The badge is completed in the 
[Thesis Open Badge Moodle](https://learn.hamk.fi/course/view.php?id=7618).

## Seminars

You will hold three presentations i.e. seminars related to your work: 

- a planning seminar, where you present the framework of your work, a preliminary table
of contents and the knowledge base
- an interim seminar, where the reporting process is well underway, and you have written
the main contents
- a final seminar, where you present your finished thesis.

The practicalities for the planning and interim seminars, such as the presentation
method and the audience, are determined by the degree programme. Towards the end
of your studies, you will familiarise yourself in advance with interim and final
seminar events. This includes your degree programme’s seminar and registration
practices as well as scheduling. 

## Acting as an opponent

Each thesis will have an opponent, and each student will in turn act as an opponent
for another student’s thesis. This usually takes place at the interim seminar stage.
The opponents focus on both the produced text and the presentation. See your degree
programme's instructions regarding opponent selection and scheduling for more information.

## English language check

The thesis will be submitted to the English teacher for comments via Wihi already at
the interim stage. In addition, the English teacher will give a numerical assessment
of the finished thesis in Wihi. The English teacher will check the abstract,
which is delivered together with the Finnish summary via Wihi in the final stage of
the process. Reserve three weeks for the evaluation of the thesis and the inspection
of the abstract. 

Send the file for commenting by downloading the file and clicking "Send for external comments".
You can find the feedback you received in the section "Statements by interest groups".
See the contact details of your degree programme’s  English teachers in the programme-specific
instructions. 

## Maturity test

Instructions for the maturity test can be found on 
[HAMK’s thesis page](https://www.hamk.fi/planning-studies/final-thesis/?lang=en)
(Appendix 6). You must register for the maturity test in accordance with your own degree programme.

## Feedback

It is important that you give the student's feedback on the thesis process after
completing your work. Once your thesis has been evaluated, you will receive an
email with a link to the feedback survey via Wihi.
